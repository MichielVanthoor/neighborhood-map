# Neighborhood Map

This asynchronous web application shows a map with my favourite brunch places in Amsterdam.
It provides a search functionality and visual interaction as well.
When a certain brunch place is selected, an info window will pop up and show 1 of the Foursquare tips belonging to this location. Enjoy!
